tspl-basic-heat-pipe=Basic heat pipe

[entity-description]
tspl-thermal-solar-panel=Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night.
tspl-thermal-solar-panel-large=Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night. Large version.
tspl-basic-heat-exchanger=Uses water and heat to produce steam at __1__°C.
tspl-basic-heat-pipe=A lesser version of the Heat Pipe.

[technology-name]
tspl-thermal-solar-power=Thermal solar power

[technology-description]
tspl-thermal-solar-power=Allows you to build a thermal solar complex, a renewable source of steam. Especially useful for steam power.

[mod-setting-name]
enable-heat-exchanger-color=Basic heat exchanger color option
custom-panel-nominal-heat-generation-kW=Thermal solar panel heat energy output (kW)
custom-exchanger-conversion-rate-kW=Basic heat exchanger steam energy output (kW)
custom-exchanger-temperature-target=Basic heat exchanger steam temperature (°C)
choose-mod-compatibility=Choose Mod Compatibility

[mod-setting-description]
enable-heat-exchanger-color=Gives a nice, [font=default-semibold][color=yellow]yellow paintjob[/color][/font] to the basic heat exchanger. Helps differentiate it from the heat exchanger.
custom-panel-nominal-heat-generation-kW=The maximum amount of heat energy that the thermal solar panel will generate during the day (range: 0-250kW).\nThe net output is significantly lower at the target temperature of the basic heat exchanger, due to heat loss!
custom-exchanger-conversion-rate-kW=The maximum amount of energy converted within the basic heat exchanger. The default of 1,800kW equals 60/s of 165°C steam (range: 1-10,000kW).
custom-exchanger-temperature-target=The target temperature for production of steam in the basic heat exchanger (range: 100-500°C).
choose-mod-compatibility=This setting enables adaptations to various mods (only 1 right now in 2.0!). I recommend changing the energy parameters to something suitable as well.

[string-mod-setting]
choose-mod-compatibility-Pyanodon=Pyanodon [img=info]

[string-mod-setting-description]
choose-mod-compatibility-Pyanodon=Lowers heat loss rate for the thermal solar panel to allow similarly efficient production of steam at 250°C.\nSuggested values: Exchanger 3,700kW/250°C.

tspl-thermal-solar-panel=Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night. Once the temperature reaches a certain threshold, it may drive a heat exchanger to produce steam.
tspl-thermal-solar-panel-large=Much larger version of the thermal solar panel. Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night. Once the temperature reaches a certain threshold, it may drive a heat exchanger to produce steam.

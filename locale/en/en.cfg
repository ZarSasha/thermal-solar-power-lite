[mod-setting-description]
enable-heat-exchanger-color=Gives a nice, [font=default-semibold][color=yellow]yellow paintjob[/color][/font] to the Basic Heat Exchanger. Helps differentiate it from the Heat Exchanger.
custom-panel-nominal-heat-generation-kW=The maximum amount of heat energy that the Thermal Solar Panel will generate during the day (range: 0-250kW).
custom-exchanger-conversion-rate-kW=The maximum amount of energy converted within the Basic Heat Exchanger. The default of 1,800kW equals 60/s of 165°C steam (range: 1-10,000kW).
custom-exchanger-temperature-target=The target temperature for production of steam in the Basic Heat Exchanger (range: 100-500°C).
choose-mod-compatibility=This setting enables adaptations to various mods (only 1 right now in 2.0!). I recommend changing the energy parameters to something suitable as well.

tspl-thermal-solar-panel=Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night. Once the temperature reaches a certain threshold, it may drive a heat exchanger to produce steam.
tspl-thermal-solar-panel-large=Much larger version of the Thermal Solar Panel. Produces heat from sunlight, slowly cooling down at night. Once the temperature reaches a certain threshold, it may drive a heat exchanger to produce steam.
